Memory is splitted in half. The top half contains conses while the bottom half
hold atoms, so the top bit of a pointer to an object already tells to what kind
of object it points to. The high byte of atom pointers tell if the atom is NIL
or a number.

Furthermore, pointers and atom length have to be even. The lowest bits are
reserved for garbage collection.
