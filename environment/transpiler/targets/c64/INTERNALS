Memory is splitted in half. The top half contains conses while the bottom half
hold atoms, so the top bit of a pointer to an object already tells to what kind
of object it points to. The high byte of atom pointers tell if the atom is NIL
or a number.

Furthermore, pointers and atom length have to be even. The lowest bits are
reserved for garbage collection.

Bytecode functions are compiled to 6502 code just in time. The functions are
loaded from disk for that. The atom pool serves as a cache of compiled functions
controlled by a circular table. 1 byte memorizer.
