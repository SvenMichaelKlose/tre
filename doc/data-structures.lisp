DATA STRUCTURES

	<para>
    	Square brackets express access to a list or tree structure. The first
    	element in a 'square' expression is the data structure from which an
    	element should be read, followed by the element name. Further elements
    	may follow, if the former element is also a data structure.
    	If the element name is an integer, it denotes the Nth element in the list.
