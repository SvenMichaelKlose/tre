ABOUT

    This is tré, a metamorphic transpiler for a dialect of the
    Lisp family of programming languages.  It can generate C,
    ECMAScript/JavaScript, PHP and a dedicated bytecode.  Except
    for PHP tré can compile itself to all other targets.

BUILD & INSTALL

    Make sure you have libdl, libffi and their headers installed.
    Then, simply run

        # ./make.sh boot
        # ./make.sh install

    and enjoy yourself for a couple of minutes.  The interpreter
    is rather slow, but things get boosted after the initial
    round of which there are two.

    The binary is installed to /usr/local/bin/tre.


COMMAND-LINE

    Invoke tré with the -h argument and it tells you all it knows
    about its command-line options and arguments.

        # tre -h


ABOUT THE INTERPRETER

    Opposite to the compiler the interpreter has no lexical scopging
    but surprisingly it copes with the compiler source anyway.
    Hopefully, the interpreter is replaced by the compiler, soon.


THE DIALECT

    The dialect's most notable features are:

      - lexical scoping (except for the interpreter),
      - anonymous macros (QUASIQUOTE doesn't need BACKQUOTE),
      - a terse dot-notation CAR and CDR.
      - no LAMBDA symbol required in literal functions

DOCUMENTATION

    The most detailed documentation of the environment is the code
    itself.
