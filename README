TRÉ

ABOUT

    tré is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages.
    This compiler translates it into various other programming
    languages or codes.

PREPARE LINUX

    Install libffi and headers.

        # aptitude install libffi-dev

BUILD & INSTALL

    Make sure you have libdl, libffi and their headers installed.
    Then, simply run

        # ./make.sh boot

    and enjoy yourself for a couple of minutes.  The interpreter
    is rather slow, but things get boosted after the initial
    round of which there are two.

    The binary is installed to /usr/local/bin/tre.


COMMAND-LINE

    Invoke tré with the -h argument and it tells you all it knows
    about its command-line options and arguments.


ABOUT THE INTERPRETER

    Opposite to the compiler the interpreter has no lexical scopging
    but surprisingly it copes with the compiler source anyway.
    Hopefully, the interpreter is replaced by the compiler soon.


THE DIALECT

    The dialect's most notable features are:

      - lexical scoping (except the interpreter),
      - a variable, function and package per symbol,
      - anonymous macros (QUASIQUOTE doesn't need BACKQUOTE),
      - a terse dot-notation for one or nested CARs and CDRs.
      - no LAMBDA symbol required in literal functions

DOCUMENTATION

    The most detailed documentation if the environment is the code
    itself.
