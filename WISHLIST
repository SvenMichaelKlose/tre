- free mix of &OPTIONAL, &REST and &KEY arguments.
- deftype
- defgeneric/defmethod
- reverse execution
- implicit closure arguments?
- data evaluation

- Setting NIL is ignored. Saves dummy vars. Or change argument orders.

- (defmacro name (arg (eval arg)) ...) optional evaluation to save gensym expressions.
- &KEY after &REST

- Argument definition:

	(defun something ((form #'some-filter)))
	(a 'b c) <- b is passed unevaluated

- 4TH-CELL is a whole symbol, regardless of it starting with a number
- TYPEDEF - make cons another type.

- rename imported symbol (alias)
- : is IN-SCOPE. Allows `(,pack:sym)

- M-V-B/WITH: assignment to NIL is ignored.

- =: Many arguments.

- Pattern-matching macro definitions.

- File origin for atoms and conses.

- History: Call tree.

- &REQUIRED-KEY

- &SELF-OPTIONAL: Only usable when self-called.

- . alias for CONS

- ??? QUASIQUOTE escape for macro macros.

- . for &REST (implies argument definition without () == (&rest arg))

- Argument macros, inlined macros

- TREScript: DEFMETHOD - have argument expansion.

- Nested DEFSTRUCT.

- (defun bla (x y z)
   x..) ; x + rest
x + y + z

- symbol construction syntax, alternative to $.
	'head-,name'-tail

- (fun1+fun2 ...) => (fun1 ...) (fun2 ...)
- take list of functions

- Arithmetic functions ignore NIL.
