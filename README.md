The tré programming language
============================

tré compiles a cross-compatible dialect of Lisp to JavaScript, PHP 7+ and
Common Lisp.  You can [find the documentation here](doc/index.md) or
[chat along here](https://github.com/SvenMichaelKlose/tre/discussions) and
feel free to hack along as it's a simple micro-pass compiler that hosts itself.

# State of the project

tré is being developed by a single individual since 2005 unless you change
that.  There are [super-important things to do](TODO.md) before true magic sets
in.  If you want to test something, just branch out from
[the master branch](https://github.com/SvenMichaelKlose/tre/) which is supposed
to be stable.

# Version numbers

The marketing department got fired so there are none.
