# Overview

This is tré, a metamorphic Lisp transpiler.  It can generate C,
ECMAScript/JavaScript, PHP and a dedicated bytecode.


# IMPORTANT:

The C and bytecode target is currently broken.
The JavaScript target works but just not for the whole transpiler.


# Building and installing

Make sure you have sbcl installed installed.  Then, simply run

```
./make.sh boot
./make.sh install
```

and enjoy yourself for a couple of minutes.


# Invokation

Invoke tré with the -h argument and it tells you all it knows
about its command-line options and arguments.

```
tre -h
```
