TRE releases

Version numbers contain a major, minor and micro- version number separated
by dots. If the minor version is an even number, the release is stable.
Uneven minor versions are for releases under construction.

This file is maintained accurately for stable releases. See Changelog for
most recent changes in unstable releases.

	- BIT-OR, BIT-AND, <<, >>: New bit-level operations.
	- STRING-DOWNCASE: New function convert string to lower case.

	- Improved alien interface and configurable C calls.
	- ED: New built-in editor for ANSI terminals.

	DEBUGGING

	- Errors are now correcteable. Retries until user input is valid.
	- If first element is not a function, print the unevaluated value.
	- Show built-in functions in backtrace.

	GARBAGE COLLECTOR

	- GC statistics don't include conses used internally.
	- GC can call TRE functions.
	- Symbol GC won't lose last symbol anymore.

	MISCELLANOUS
