TRE releases

Version numbers contain a major, minor and micro- version number separated
by dots. If the minor version is an even number, the release is stable.
Uneven minor versions are for releases under construction.

This file is maintained accurately for stable releases. See Changelog for
most recent changes in unstable releases.

0.4.0
	DIALECT

	- Numbers now have double precision.
	- Lexical scope in macros.
	- LAMBDA keyowrd is optional. Removed from environment.
	- Hexadecimal notation (#x<NUMBER>) introduced.
	- Dot-notation for CONSes: Dot must must follow a whitespace or it's part
      the symbol.
	- Lexical scoping removed.
	- Argument type checks for built-in functions added.

	- Raw memory access and allocation (Mew: %%SET, %%GET, %MALLOC, %FREE)
	- New predicate SYMBOLP: Returns T if variable points to itself. NIL otherwise.
	- New macro WITH merges LET*, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND and LABELS.
	- New macro SELF denotes currently DEFUNed function.
	- Expansion of nested BACKQUOTEs reversed. QUOTEs are always evaluated.

	- DEFCONSTANT: New.
	- ERROR takes formatted string (New: %ERROR).
	- APPEND/NCONC now ignore empty lists.
	- APPEND also copies last list.
	- MAKE-HASH-TABLE: Now symbols can be used as keys.
	- TREE-WALK: Now returns a copy of the tree (which may be modified).
	- DEFSTRUCT: Now also defines WITH-<structname> macro.
	- FORMAT: Now ignores unknown directives. Returns a string if stream is NIL.
	- PRINT: Print keyword package atom.
	- ELT: Returns NIL if sequence is NIL.
	- STRING: Converts character to single-character string.
	- CHAR-STRING: Removed.
	- %TERMINA-RAW: New: Switch off terminal buffering and echoing.
	- %TERMINA-NORMAL: New: Switch on terminal buffering and echoing.
	- DECF: Fixed - behaved like INCF.
	- FRESH-LINE: Fixed - always printed to standard output.
	- GROUP: New function splits up sequences into equally sized chunks.
	- SUBSEQ: Now not only works with lists but also with strings and arrays.
	- CASE: Expression optional after match.
	- $: New function converts arguments to strings, concatenates them and
	  makes a new symbol.
	- BIT-OR, BIT-AND, <<, >>: New bit-level operations.
	- CHAR-DOWNCASE, STRING-DOWNCASE: New functions convert to lower case.
	- DOCUMENTATION: Also print arguments.
	- END-OF-FILE: Now tells if *STANDARD-INPUT* ends.
	- QUEUE-POP: Pops first element off a queue and returns its value.
	- IN?, IN=?: New macros check if element occurs in the rest of its arguments.
	- MAKE-STRING-STREAM: Formerly MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM. Now bidirectional.
	- GET-STRING-STREAM: Empties the stream.
	- SYMBOL-PACKAGE: New built-in function returns package of a symbol.
	- STRING-CONCAT: Ignores NIL.
	- READ: New function reads and returns expression from stream.

	- EXEC, FORK, WAIT: New functions for process execution.

	- ED: New built-in editor for ANSI terminals.

	DEBUGGING

	- Errors are now correcteable. Retries until user input is valid.
	- If first element is not a function, print the unevaluated value.
	- Show built-in functions in backtrace.
	- Switch to debugger on SIGINT (CTRL+C), except when reading from standard input.
	- Displays current stream/file name, line and column on warning or error.

	GARBAGE COLLECTOR

	- GC statistics don't include conses used internally.
	- GC can call TRE functions.
	- Symbol GC won't lose last symbol anymore.

	MISCELLANOUS

	- Fixed standard input stream.
	- Exit if standard input stream ends (CTRL+D).
	- Symbol table now maintained in character tree.
	- Interpreter keyword arguments: no more lengthy seeks in symbol table.

	ALIEN INTERFACE

	- Improved alien interface and configurable C calls.
	- ALIEN-CALL-1 reintroduced. Calls C function with one argument.
	- %MALLOC, %FREE: Built-in functions.

	COMPILER (under construction)

	- Compiler BACKQUOTE expansion added.
	- Compiler: CBLOCKs vanished.

0.2.1 (2007/07/07):

    The machine can be dumped and loaded to/from an image. See new
    built-in functions SYS-IMAGE-CREATE and SYS-IMAGE-LOAD.

0.2.0 (2007/06/28):

    After endless experimenting with various designs, this is the first
    stable release.
